All mods will be in this folder, with the structure mods/modname/xxxx
In your modname folder will be your modname.mod file and a directory structure matching the one in /data/ if you want to override any art files

I repeat: You can replace any in-game data files by including them here in your mod folder with the same filename (mods/modname/etc/)

So for example, for a mod that replaces this file:
C:\kenshi\data\buildings\materials\construction.dds
your mod would look like this:
C:\kenshi\mods\modname\buildings\materials\construction.dds
C:\kenshi\mods\modname\modname.mod

To create a new mod open the "Forgotten construction set" and choose the "new mod" button at startup.
To convert an old mod from pre 0.92.0, copy the .mod file from /data/ to /mods/modname/
